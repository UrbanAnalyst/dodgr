#' Compare timings of different sort heaps for a given input graph.
#'
#' Perform timing comparison between different kinds of heaps as well as with
#' equivalent routines from the \pkg{igraph} package. To do this, a random
#' sub-graph containing a defined number of vertices is first selected.
#' Alternatively, this random sub-graph can be pre-generated with the
#' `dodgr_sample` function and passed directly.
#'
#' @param graph `data.frame` object representing the network graph (or a
#' sub-sample selected with code{dodgr_sample})
#' @param nverts Number of vertices used to generate random sub-graph. If a
#' non-numeric value is given, the whole graph will be used.
#' @param replications Number of replications to be used in comparison
#' @return Result of `bench::mark` comparison.
#'
#' @note \pkg{igraph} caches intermediate results of graph processing, so
#' the \pkg{igraph} comparisons will be faster on subsequent runs. To obtain
#' fair comparisons, run only once or re-start the current R session.
