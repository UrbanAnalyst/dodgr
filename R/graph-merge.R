#' Merge directed edges into equivalent undirected edges.
#'
#' Merge directed edges into equivalent undirected values by aggregating across
#' directions. This function is primarily intended to aid visualisation of
#' directed graphs, particularly visualising the results of the
#' \link{dodgr_flows_aggregate} and \link{dodgr_flows_disperse} functions, which
#' return columns of aggregated flows directed along each edge of a graph.
#'
#' @param graph A undirected graph in which directed edges of the input graph
#' have been merged through aggregation to yield a single, undirected edge
#' between each pair of vertices.
#' @param col_names Names of columns to be merged through aggregation. Values
#' for these columns in resultant undirected graph will be aggregated from
#' directed values.
#' @return An equivalent graph in which all directed edges have been reduced to
#' single, undirected edges, and all values of the specified column(s) have been
#' aggregated across directions to undirected values.
