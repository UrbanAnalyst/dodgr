#' Distances On Directed GRaphs ("dodgr")
#'
#' Distances on dual-weighted directed graphs using priority-queue shortest
#' paths. Weighted directed graphs have weights from A to B which may differ
#' from those from B to A. Dual-weighted directed graphs have two sets of such
#' weights. A canonical example is a street network to be used for routing in
#' which routes are calculated by weighting distances according to the type of
#' way and mode of transport, yet lengths of routes must be calculated from
#' direct distances.
#'
#' @section The Main Function:
#' \itemize{
#' \item [dodgr_dists()]: Calculate pair-wise distances between
#' specified pairs of points in a graph.
#' }
#'
#' @section Functions to Obtain Graphs:
#' \itemize{
#' \item [dodgr_streetnet()]: Extract a street network in Simple
#' Features (`sf`) form.
#' \item [weight_streetnet()]: Convert an `sf`-formatted street
#' network to a `dodgr` graph through applying specified weights to all
#' edges.
#' }
#'
#' @section Functions to Modify Graphs:
#' \itemize{
#' \item [dodgr_components()]: Number all graph edges according to
#' their presence in distinct connected components.
#' \item [dodgr_contract_graph()]: Contract a graph by removing
#' redundant edges.
#' }
#'
#' @section Miscellaneous Functions:
#' \itemize{
#' \item [dodgr_sample()]: Randomly sample a graph, returning a single
#' connected component of a defined number of vertices.
#' \item [dodgr_vertices()]: Extract all vertices of a graph.
#' \item [compare_heaps()]: Compare the performance of different
#' priority queue heap structures for a given type of graph.

#' Weighting profiles used to route different modes of transport.
#'
#' Collection of weighting profiles used to adjust the routing process to
#' different means of transport. Modified from data taken from the Routino
#' project, with additional tables for average speeds, dependence of speed on
#' type of surface, and waiting times in seconds at traffic lights. The latter
#' table (called "penalties") includes waiting times at traffic lights (in
#' seconds), additional time penalties for turning across oncoming traffic
#' ("turn"), and a binary flag indicating whether turn restrictions should be
#' obeyed or not.
