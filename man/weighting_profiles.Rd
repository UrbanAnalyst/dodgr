\title{Weighting profiles used to route different modes of transport.}
\format{
List of \code{data.frame} objects with profile names, means of transport
and weights.
}
\description{
Collection of weighting profiles used to adjust the routing process to
different means of transport. Modified from data taken from the Routino
project, with additional tables for average speeds, dependence of speed on
type of surface, and waiting times in seconds at traffic lights. The latter
table (called "penalties") includes waiting times at traffic lights (in
seconds), additional time penalties for turning across oncoming traffic
("turn"), and a binary flag indicating whether turn restrictions should be
obeyed or not.
