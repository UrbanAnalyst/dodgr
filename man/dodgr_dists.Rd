\arguments{
\item{graph}{\code{data.frame} or equivalent object representing the network
graph (see Notes)}

\item{from}{Vector or matrix of points \strong{from} which route distances are to
be calculated (see Notes)}

\item{to}{Vector or matrix of points \strong{to} which route distances are to be
calculated (see Notes)}

\item{shortest}{If \code{FALSE}, calculate distances along the \emph{fastest}
rather than shortest routes (see Notes).}

\item{pairwise}{If \code{TRUE}, calculate distances only between the ordered
pairs of \code{from} and \code{to}.}

\item{heap}{Type of heap to use in priority queue. Options include
Fibonacci Heap (default; \code{FHeap}), Binary Heap (\code{BHeap}),
\verb{Trinomial Heap (}TriHeap\verb{), Extended Trinomial Heap (}TriHeapExt\verb{, and 2-3 Heap (}Heap23`).}

\item{parallel}{If \code{TRUE}, perform routing calculation in parallel (see
details)}

\item{quiet}{If \code{FALSE}, display progress messages on screen.}

\value{
square matrix of distances between nodes
}
\description{
Calculate matrix of pair-wise distances between points.
}
\note{
\code{graph} must minimally contain three columns of \code{from},
\code{to}, \code{dist}. If an additional column named \code{weight} or
\code{wt} is present, shortest paths are calculated according to values
specified in that column; otherwise according to \code{dist} values. Either
way, final distances between \code{from} and \code{to} points are calculated
by default according to values of \code{dist}. That is, paths between any pair of
points will be calculated according to the minimal total sum of \code{weight}
values (if present), while reported distances will be total sums of \code{dist}
values.

For street networks produced with \link{weight_streetnet}, distances may also
be calculated along the \emph{fastest} routes with the \code{shortest = FALSE}
option. Graphs must in this case have columns of \code{time} and \code{time_weighted}.
Note that the fastest routes will only be approximate when derived from
\pkg{sf}-format data generated with the \pkg{osmdata} function
\code{osmdata_sf()}, and will be much more accurate when derived from \code{sc}-format
data generated with \code{osmdata_sc()}. See \link{weight_streetnet} for details.

The \code{from} and \code{to} columns of \code{graph} may be either single
columns of numeric or character values specifying the numbers or names of
graph vertices, or combinations to two columns specifying geographical
(longitude and latitude) coordinates. In the latter case, almost any sensible
combination of names will be accepted (for example, \verb{fromx, fromy},
\verb{from_x, from_y}, or \verb{fr_lat, fr_lon}.)

\code{from} and \code{to} values can be either two-column matrices of
equivalent of longitude and latitude coordinates, or else single columns
precisely matching node numbers or names given in \code{graph$from} or
\code{graph$to}. If \code{to} is \code{NULL}, pairwise distances are calculated
between all points specified in \code{from}. If both \code{from} and \code{to} are \code{NULL},
pairwise distances are calculated between all nodes in \code{graph}.

Calculations in parallel (\code{parallel = TRUE}) ought very generally be
advantageous. For small graphs, calculating distances in parallel is likely
to offer relatively little gain in speed, but increases from parallel
computation will generally markedly increase with increasing graph sizes.
By default, parallel computation uses the maximal number of available cores
or threads. This number can be reduced by specifying a value via
\verb{RcppParallel::setThreadOptions (numThreads = <desired_number>)}.
