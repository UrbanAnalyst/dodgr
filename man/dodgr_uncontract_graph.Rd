\title{Re-expand a contracted graph.}
\usage{
dodgr_uncontract_graph(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A contracted graph created from \link{dodgr_contract_graph}.}
}
\value{
A single \code{data.frame} representing the equivalent original,
uncontracted graph.
}
\description{
Revert a contracted graph created with \link{dodgr_contract_graph} back to
the full, uncontracted version. This function is mostly used for the side
effect of mapping any new columns inserted on to the contracted graph back
on to the original graph, as demonstrated in the example.
}
\examples{
graph0 <- weight_streetnet (hampi)
nrow (graph0) # 6,813
graph1 <- dodgr_contract_graph (graph0)
nrow (graph1) # 760
graph2 <- dodgr_uncontract_graph (graph1)
nrow (graph2) # 6,813

# Insert new data on to the contracted graph and uncontract it:
graph1$new_col <- runif (nrow (graph1))
graph3 <- dodgr_uncontract_graph (graph1)
# graph3 is then the uncontracted graph which includes "new_col" as well
dim (graph0)
dim (graph3)
