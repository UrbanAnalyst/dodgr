\title{Match spatial points to the vertices of a spatial graph.}
\usage{
match_pts_to_verts(verts, xy, connected = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{verts}{A \code{data.frame} of vertices obtained from
\code{dodgr_vertices(graph)}.}

\item{xy}{coordinates of points to be matched to the vertices, either as
matrix or \pkg{sf}-formatted \code{data.frame}.}

\item{connected}{Should points be matched to the same (largest) connected
component of graph? If \code{FALSE} and these points are to be used for a
\code{dodgr} routing routine (\link{dodgr_dists}, \link{dodgr_paths}, or
\link{dodgr_flows_aggregate}), then results may not be returned if points are
not part of the same connected component. On the other hand, forcing them to
be part of the same connected component may decrease the spatial accuracy of
matching.}
}
\value{
A vector index into verts
}
\description{
The \link{match_pts_to_graph} function matches points to the nearest edge
based on geometric intersections; this function only matches to the nearest
vertex based on point-to-point distances.
}
\examples{
net <- weight_streetnet (hampi, wt_profile = "foot")
verts <- dodgr_vertices (net)
# Then generate some random points to match to graph
npts <- 10
xy <- data.frame (
    x = min (verts$x) + runif (npts) * diff (range (verts$x)),
    y = min (verts$y) + runif (npts) * diff (range (verts$y))
)
pts <- match_pts_to_verts (verts, xy)
pts # an index into verts
pts <- verts$id [pts]
pts # names of those vertices
