Shortest path distances can calculated dodgr priority queues use following heaps: Binary heaps; Fibonacci heaps (Fredman Tarjan 1987); Trinomial extended trinomial heaps (Takaoka 2000); 2-3 heaps (Takaoka 1999). Differences heaps operate often largely extraneous direct application routing algorithms, even though heap choice may strongly affect performance. avoid users needing know anything algorithmic details, dodgr provides function compare_heaps() particular graph may submitted order determine optimal kind heap. comparisons actually made randomly selected sub-component graph containing defined number vertices (default 1,000, entire graph contains fewer 1,000 vertices). key column data.frame relative, quantifies relative performance test relation best given score 1. dodgr using default heap = \"BHeap\", binary heap priority queue, performs faster igraph (Csardi Nepusz 2006) graphs. Different kind graphs perform differently different priority queue structures, function enables users empirically discern optimal heap kind graph. Note, however, entirely fair comparison, dodgr calculates dual-weighted distances, whereas igraph—indeed R packages—directly calculate distances based single set weights. Implementing dual-weighted routing cases requires explicitly re-tracing paths summing second set weights along path. time comparison case strongly favour dodgr.
