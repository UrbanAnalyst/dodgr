Shortest path distances can calculated dodgr priority queues use following heaps: Binary heaps; Fibonacci heaps (Fredman Tarjan 1987); Trinomial extended trinomial heaps (Takaoka 2000); 2-3 heaps (Takaoka 1999). Differences heaps operate often largely extraneous direct application routing algorithms, even though heap choice may strongly affect performance. avoid users needing know anything algorithmic details, dodgr provides function compare_heaps() particular graph may submitted order determine optimal kind heap. comparisons actually made randomly selected sub-component graph containing defined number vertices (default 1,000, entire graph contains fewer 1,000 vertices). key column data.frame relative, quantifies relative performance test relation best given score 1. dodgr using default heap = \"BHeap\", binary heap priority queue, performs faster igraph (Csardi Nepusz 2006) graphs. Different kind graphs perform differently different priority queue structures, function enables users empirically discern optimal heap kind graph.

Implementing dual-weighted routing cases requires explicitly re-tracing paths summing second set weights along path. time comparison case strongly favour dodgr.

Figure 1 depicts right-angled crossing, straight arrows showing single directed edge crossing (solid black line), three directed edges going (solid grey lines). Turning across oncoming traffic generally takes time (precise values detailed following section), turning left (\\(\\rightarrow B\\) Fig. 1) always different turning right (\\(\\rightarrow C\\)). reflect differences, graphs weighted account turning penalties adding three “compound” edges directly connecting \\(\\) end points \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), including additional time penalties turning across oncoming traffic.
